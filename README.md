Script to update Gogs

If the is no previous installation, gogsupdater install Gogs.

Be careful, gogsupdate dot NOT restart the Gogs server and you have to do this manually. If you use Gogs as a daemon, you can add a line at the end of the script to restart the server (look into your distribution documentation to know how to restart a service), but do this only if you absolutly know what you're doing !
